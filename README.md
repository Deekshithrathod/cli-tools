# cli-tools

Planning to add more CLI tools

I know that CLI applications are supposed to be fast, but I would love to make some REST API based CLI tools just for fun sometime
- [ ] A CLI tool that fetches song's lyrics and turns it into Karaoke
- [ ] A CLI tool that fetches meaning of a word right from your terminal, no ads no bloatware nothing, just the words and their meanings ( should by default limit it to 10 results, unless the user asks for the word)
- [ ] A CLI tool that types in some random stuff/scripts on to the terminal as if the user is hacking (will have to user chalk modules in js for this to print text in green.
